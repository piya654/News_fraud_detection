 📰 News Fraud Detection using Machine Learning
This project focuses on detecting **fraudulent or misleading news articles** using advanced **Machine Learning (ML)** and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques. It aims to identify fake or manipulated news content to promote authenticity and trust in digital media.
🚀 Features
- Preprocessing of news text data (tokenization, stopword removal, stemming)
- Vectorization using TF-IDF / CountVectorizer
- Classification using ML models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM)
- Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Visualization of results for better interpretability
🧠 Technologies Used
- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Scikit-learn  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn  
- NLTK / SpaCy
